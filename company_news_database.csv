Earlier, the fee was only applicable to all non-members and members (Zomato Gold and Swiggy One users) were exempt from paying any additional amount.

Swiggy and Zomato did not immediately reply to Moneycontrol’s queries. The move comes at a time when Zomato and Swiggy are both under immense investor pressure to improve their profit profile. Eternal, which runs Zomato, reported a 78 percent year-on-year (YoY) decline in quarterly profit after tax (PAT) at Rs 39 crore in the fourth quarter (Q4) of financial year 2024-25 (FY25), down from Rs 175 crore in the same period a year ago.
