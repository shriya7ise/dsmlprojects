The Nifty 50 index rose close to 24,900 level, recovering from the previous session’s loss. Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M), HDFC Life Insurance Company, Bharti Airtel, Jio Financial Services, Trend and Shriram Finance were among the top gainers in the Nifty 50 index.

In the options market, the highest Open Interest (OI) on the Call side is at the 25,000 strike, followed by 24,900 and 25,100, which could act as resistance levels, according to Axis Securities. On the Put side, the highest Open Interest is at 24,800, followed by 24,700 and 24,500, which may serve as support levels. The premium for the At-the-Money option is  ₹412, indicating a likely trading range for the week between 24,300 and 25,200, Axis Securities said.

A Bear Put Spread involves buying a Put option with higher strike and simultaneously selling a Put option with lower strike to offset part of the upfront cost. This strategy is characterized by limited risk and limited profit potential, making it suitable for traders anticipating a moderate decline in the underlying Nifty 50 index.

Food delivery majors Zomato (now Eternal) and Swiggy have both removed the surge fee waiver during rains for their loyalty programme users, according to in-app updates. The move essentially means customers who are enrolled under Zomato Gold and Swiggy One – the respective loyalty membership plans of these companies – will also have to pay an additional amount for their deliveries when it rains in their area. Earlier, the fee was only applicable to all non-members and members (Zomato Gold and Swiggy One users) were exempt from paying any additional amount. However, according to the latest update, Zomato Gold members/Swiggy One users will be treated on par with non-members and made to pay an additional amount for food deliveries, despite them paying an additional enrolment fee for the loyalty programme. Swiggy and Zomato did not immediately reply to Moneycontrol’s queries. The move comes at a time when Zomato and Swiggy are both under immense investor pressure to improve their profit profile. Eternal, which runs Zomato, reported a 78 percent year-on-year (YoY) decline in quarterly profit after tax (PAT) at Rs 39 crore in the fourth quarter (Q4) of financial year 2024-25 (FY25), down from Rs 175 crore in the same period a year ago.

Abbott and MSD Pharmaceuticals on Wednesday announced a strategic distribution partnership to expand access to MSD’s oral anti-diabetic portfolio in India, including sitagliptin and its fixed-dose combinations. Under the agreement, Abbott will leverage its extensive distribution network to market MSD’s sitagliptin-based brands—Januvia, Janumet, and Janumet XR—which remain category leaders despite the loss of exclusivity. Sitagliptin, a DPP-4 inhibitor introduced in India in 2008, has been a cornerstone in Type 2 diabetes management, helping reduce HbA1c levels and improve glycemic control. The drug patents expired in India in July 2022, which has triggered a wave of generic launches and steep price corrections across the market. Despite the influx of generics, MSD still retains significant market share of sitagliptin in value terms, underscoring the brand’s resilience. India’s oral anti-diabetic drug market is valued at Rs 12,500 crore, with DPP-4 inhibitors accounting for Rs 4,000 crore. Sitagliptin remains the gold standard in this category, commanding over 60% of the global market share. India has over 101 million people living with diabetes and another 136 million are pre-diabetic. With non-communicable diseases accounting for 60% of deaths in India, the collaboration aims to address a critical public health challenge. “The partnership with Abbott establishes a sustainable model to continue serving patients across India,” said Rehan A. Khan, Managing Director, MSD India Region. Abbott’s Vice President Ambati Venu emphasized the company’s commitment to integrated diabetes care, including diagnostics, monitoring, nutrition, and therapeutics. The Abbott-MSD alliance reflects a broader trend of multinational firms adapting to post-patent landscapes by forging local partnerships to maintain market presence and scale access.
